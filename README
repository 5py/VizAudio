Overview:
     libVizAudio is a GTK-based system that links audio events to visual events. It is primarily
    meant as an accessibility tool for deaf users. VizAudio takes advantage of the 
    enhanced sound information provided by applications that use the audio framework
    libCanberra. For the sake of generalizability and extensibility, libVizAudio is not 
    directly a  part of libCanberra. It is a tool that operates in parallel with libCanberra
    to enhance the user experience. libVizAudio functions by constantly listening for
    libCanberra sound playing calls on the D-BUS. When a sound method call is heard,
    vizAudio uses the information given to libCanberra in that call to determine the
    relevant sound-event to play. If none is found for this audio event, Users will be
    given the option to assign a pre-made visual event to play whenever this audio
    event is played. These visual events make use of basic GTK drawing and more
    advanced Cairo vector graphics.
